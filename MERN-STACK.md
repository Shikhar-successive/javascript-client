# MERN STACK
The MERN stack is an **combination of four technologies**. This combination allows developers to create complete websites (back-end and front-end). With the MERN stack, we use JavaScript on the client side and Node.js on the server side. The MERN stack was created to give *full stack developers* the ability to develop a site from start to finish, without having to know or use another skill.

## What technologies make up the MERN stack?

## **MongoDB**

**MongoDB** allows you to manage databases. It differs from SQL. MongoDB is used in the MEAN stack because the data is manipulated in JSON format. It is also really simple to transform JavaScript data into MongoDB and vice versa, thanks to libraries such as mongoose, for example. Data manipulation becomes child’s play, with efficiency and simplicity.

## **Node.js**

**Node.js** works with JavaScript. These two languages ​​are strongly linked and are able to interact with each other very easily. Therefore, a developer proficient in JavaScript will have no difficulty learning from Node.JS.

In addition, Node.JS has the distinction of being an extremely fast language – one of the fastest languages ​​ ​​in computer programming – because it is also an asynchronous language. Renowned companies such as Facebook use Node.js.

## **Express**

**Express** is a data modeling language that formally specifies data. It provides the ability to develop a complex web application. Express uses the middleware system, which is dedicated to managing highly complex web applications. Express is used for the creation of the REST API. The REST API corresponds to a website that will retrieve data via HTTP requests. These queries are executed with the React.js language.

## **React.js**

**React.js** is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook since 2013. React.js develops the front-end part of the website, and is renowned for accelerating the loading speeds of websites in general. Animations, uploads and any other transition are made much faster. For example, Netflix uses React.js, and the language is the best technological choice if you want to develop a web application, mobile application or even software quickly.
